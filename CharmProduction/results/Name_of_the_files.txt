dXdy_channel_mQ_qSupp_Nsamples_Qmin_Qmax_etaovers_Area_alphas_centralityaveraged.txt
X = {Charm, Dilepton}
channel = {gg for gluon scattering, qq for quark scattering, PreEq gluon scattering and quark scattering}
mQ = Charm mass (GeV)
qSupp = {1 if we take into account the quark suppression factor, 0 if not}
NSamples = number of samples to perform the monte carlo integration
QMin, QMax = invariant mass of the quarkonia for integration
etaovers = value of η/s
Area = value of the area A (if nothing, Area = 110)
alphas = value of alphas (if nothing, alphas=0.3)
centralityaveraged = centralityaveraged if the result is averaged over the centrality (if nothing, the result is calculated for a 0-5% centrality)
