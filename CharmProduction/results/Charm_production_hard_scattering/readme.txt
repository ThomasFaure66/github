Charmproduction_hard_scattering_withshadowng_renormalised.txt is the production of charms due to hard scattering, calculated from the cross section given by FONLL, normalised by the pp measurement dσcc/dy(y<0.5)=1165 μb. The production takes into account the shadowing.

Charmproduction_hard_scattering_noshadowing_norenormalization.txt is the production of charms due to hard scattering, calculated from the cross section given by FONLL
Charmproduction_hard_scattering_noshadowing_norenormalization_morepoints.txt is the production of charm due to hard scattering, calculated from the cross section given by FONLL (just with more points).

cross_section_hard_scattering.txt is the cross section calculated with FONLL

getproduction_hard_scattering_noshadowhing_norenormalization.cpp calculates the production of charms due to hard scattering from the cross section calculated with FONLL (without shadowing and without renormalization).
getproduction_hard_scattering.cpp calculates the production of charms due to hard scattering from the cross section calculated with FONLL wih the shadowing and renormalised by the pp measurement.



Folder : Hard_scattering_production_different_centrality 
Production of charms due to hard scattering (without shadowing and without renormalization) calculted for different centrality (ex : 5_10.txt is for a centrality of 0-5%).
Charmproduction_hard_scattering_centralityaveraged.txt is the production of charms due to hard scattering averaged over the centrality (without shadowing and without renormalization).
